# Morse_Code_Decryptor
Complex analysis being turn into an efficient and yet simple algorithm, written in C++ using dynamic memory allocation constraints to decrypt Morse Code. The program asks for number of '.' and '-', and decrpyts the combination in a letter. An updated version to decrypt whole meesage into meaningful sentence is in progress.
